title: "Ocean Biogeochemistry Cookbook"
abstract: "This Project Pythia Cookbook covers working with various sources of ocean biogeochemistry data, including Community Earth System Model (CESM) output and observational data. It provides a brief introduction to some metrics important to ocean biogeochemistry, from physical quantities like temperature to biological quantities like plankton biomass. It also demonstrates some of the data science techniques used to work with this information, and provides an introduction to the relationship between modeled and observational estimates."
